        <img class="top-cloud" src="images/cloud.png" alt="cloud-image">
        <!-- EACH AND EVERY TAG IN HTML IS EITHER BLOCK DISPLAY(WHICH TAKE WHOLE HORIZONTAL SCREEN)
    COMMON BLOCKS 1)p tag 2)h tag 3)div tag 4)lists 5)forms -->
        <!-- these block elements block any other element in a horizontal line to them -->
        <!-- BUT CONSIDER A SCENARIO WHERE WE ONLY NEED TO STYLE A PARTICULAR WORD DIFFERENTLY IN TWO OR MORE WAYS, BUT KEEPING THE ENTIRE WORD INTACT AS BEFORE????? -->
        <!-- FOR THE ABOVE SCENARIO, WE HAVE A SPAN TAG(NON BLOCKING TAG)(INLINE DISPLAY ELEMENT) -->
        <!-- SOME COMMON INLINE ELEMENTS ARE 1)span 2)img 3)anchors(a) -->
        <h1 id="my-name">I'm Asmit.</h1>
        <!-- WE CAN CHANGE ANY ELEMENT TO INLINE/BLOCK BY USING DISPLAY  -->
        <!-- WE HAVE TO CHANGE ALL ELEMENTS TO INLINE BLOCK AS WE WILL THEN BE ABLE TO CHANGE ITS WIDTH/HEIGHT AND THEY WILL ALSO BE IN A SINGLE LINE -->

    </div>
    <!-- EVEN IF WE SPECIFY THE HEIGHT OF OUR DIV AS 0, IT WILL STILL HAVE THE HEIGHT OF THE CONTENT IT HOLDS -->
    <!-- TO SEPERATE OUR TEXT FROM THE BORDERS IN OUR DIV TAG, WE CAN GIVE SOME PADDING 'by giving the padding property in css' eg padding:20 px PADDING INCREASES THE SIZE OF OUR BOX -->
    <!-- MARGINS GIVE SPACE IN BETWEEN OF OTHER ELEMENTS, IT IS THE OUTERMOST AREA OF A BOX MODEL, ITS LIKE content->padding->border->margin  -->
    <!-- WIDTH AND HEIGHT CAN ALSO BE CHANGED IN CSS OR HTML -->
    <!-- <div class="middlecontainer"> -->
    <!-- </div> -->
    <!-- RULES FOR CSS POSITIONING -->
    <!-- 1) CONTENT IS EVERYTHING (WIDTH/HEIGHT IS DECIDED BY THE CONTENT) -->
    <!-- 2) ORDER COMES FROM CODE -->
    <!-- 3)CHILDREN(tags inside a tag) SIT ON PARENTS (EXAMPLE, H1 INSIDE A DIV IS DISPLAYED ON TOP(Z AXIS 3D) OF THE DIV)  -->
    <!-- 4) (very imp!!!!)USE POSITION(static,relative,absolute,fixed) CSS PROPERTY TO POSITION ELEMENTS ON SCREEN -->
    <!-- <div class="bottomcontainer"> -->
        <!-- MOVING AN IMAGE USING position :relative -->
        <!-- USE top :20px :- it moves the image down by 20px -->
        <!-- USE left :20px :- it moves the image rright by 20px -->
        <!-- USE right :20px :- it moves the image left by 20px -->
        <!-- USE bottom :20px :- it moves the image up by 20px -->
        <!-- !!MOVING AN IMAGE/ELEMENT ANYWHERE, DOESNT MOVE THE OTHER ELEMENT(it overlaps the moved image on the new element)!! -->
    <!-- </div> -->
    <!-- PADDING ONLY PADS THE CONTENT INSIDE THE DIV AND NOT THE BACKGROUND IMAGE OR BACKGROUND COLOR -->
    <!-- IMP NOTE -->
    <!-- IN ABOSOLUTE POSITIONING, WHEN THERE IS AN ELEMENT INSIDE OF AN ELEMENT AND THE POSITION OF THE INNER ATTRIBUTE IS SET AS ABSOLUTE, WHILE THAT OF THE PARENT IS RELATIVE -->
    <!-- THEN IF WE GIVE right:30px; for the chil element, then it shifts the child right such that it is 30px distance in the right from the parent, instead of just shifting it to left by 30 px -->
    <!-- ABSOLUTE POSITIONING IS USED TO POSITION ELEMENTS 'PIXEL PERFECT' -->
    <!-- FIXED POSITIONING IS USED TO FIX SOMETHING ON SCREEN WHEN SOMEONE SCROLLS DOWN IN OUR WEBSITE -->
